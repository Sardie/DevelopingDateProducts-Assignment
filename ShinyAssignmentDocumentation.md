The App features a program that tries to predict, based on the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width, the sub-species of the iris flower.

All four values are required for this simple app as it is still under development; no catches were implemented.

This means that errors are not handled and having non-numeric inputs might cause an error to occur. 

The program implements Linear Discriminant Analysis to derive at the final model. The current accuracy at more than 95%.

After entering all four required values, user should click on the "Predict" button for the prediction. 

A sample of each value and prediction should be shown on the user's first visit or refresh.
