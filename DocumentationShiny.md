#Documentation to use Shiny app

The App features a simple program to try and predict the sub-species of the iris flower. 

The program, based on the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width that users enter, tries to predict the sub-species. 

Users should enter all four values for the prediction software to work.

After entering all four values, user should click the "Predict" button for the new prediction to be calculated.

The current prediction accuracy is above 95% using Linear Discriminant Analysis.
